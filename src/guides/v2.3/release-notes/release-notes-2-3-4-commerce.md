title: Magento Commerce 2.3.4 Release Notes
---

Magento Commerce 2.3.4 offers significant platform upgrades, substantial security changes, and performance improvements.

This release includes over 220 functional fixes to the core product and  over 30 security enhancements. It includes resolution of over 275 contributions by our community members. These community contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to significant enhancements to Inventory Management and GraphQL.

{% include install/pre-release.md %}

## Security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release (for example, Magento 2.3.4) provides. Patch 2.3.3.1 (Composer package 2.3.3-p1) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.3.3.  For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.3.3-p1), see [Install Magento using Composer](https://devdocs-beta.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/composer.html#get-the-metapackage). Security-only patches include only security bug fixes, not the additional security enhancements that are included in the full patch.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, Page Builder, Inventory Management, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in separate, project-specific release information which is available in the documentation for each project.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes the following security enhancements:

#### Over 30 security enhancements that help close cross-site scripting (XSS) and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities

No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP whitelisting, [two-factor authentication](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/security/two-factor-authentication.html), use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than `/admin`, and good password hygiene. See Adobe Security Bulletin for a discussion of these fixed issues. All known exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.3.4) have been ported to 2.2.11, 1.14.4.4, and 1.9.4.4, as appropriate.

#### Security enhancements and fixes to core code

Additional security enhancements include:

*  **Removal of custom layout updates and the deprecation of layout updates to remove the opportunity for Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.  The **Custom Layout Update** field on the CMS Page Edit, Category Edit, and Product Edit pages has now been converted to a selector. You can no longer specify an entity-specific layout update with text but instead must create a physical file that  contains the layout updates and select it for use. The name of the file containing an update must follow the  conventions described here. <!--- MC-16129-->

*  **Redesigned  content template features so that only whitelisted variables can be added to templates**. This avoids the situation where administrator-defined templates such as email, newsletters, and CMS content can include variables and directives that can directly call PHP functions on objects.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment.

### Platform upgrades

The following platform upgrades help enhance website security and PCI compliance.

*  **Enhancements to the message queue framework**. Magento now supports the latest release of RabbitMQ v3.8, which is the third-party technology that underlies the Magento message queue framework. <!--- MC-14871-->

*  **Improved page caching and session storage**. This release has been tested on the latest stable release of Redis v5.0.6. <!--- MC-14877-->

*  **Enhanced support for MariaDB 10.2**. Before Magento 2.3.4, when using declarative schema with MariaDB 10.2, Magento threw an error indicating that the schema was not up-to-date after running `setup:upgrade`. With this release, we have normalized the values returned by MariaDB, which allows system integrators to use declarative schema with both MySQL and MariaDB. <!--- MC-16319 MC-17633-->

*  The core integration of the Authorize.net payment method has been deprecated. Please use the official payment integration that is available on Marketplace.

**Note**: Magento 2.3.4 has not been tested with PHP 7.1. PHP 7.1 reached EOL (End of Life) on December 1, 2019. We recommend updating your deployment to a supported version of PHP. See [Magento 2.3 technology stack requirements](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/system-requirements-tech.html) for information about supported versions.

### Performance boosts

Merchants and customers will see performance improvements as a result of these enhancements:

*  Redundant non-cached requests to the server on catalog pages have been eliminated by refactoring the customer section invalidation mechanism and improving banner cache logic. <!--- MC-19107 MC-19249-->

*  PHTML files have been refactored to better support parsing by the bundling mechanism. Our new bundling mechanism now identifies all dependencies on JavaScript. <!--- MC-19242-->

*  Added the ability to disable statistic collecting for Reports module by default. A new configuration setting (**System Configuration** > **General** > **Reports** > **General Options**)  allows merchants to completely or partially disable Magento Reports. (Statistics collection for the Reports module is disabled by default. Magento recommends disabling Reports functionality for performance reasons when this capability is not required.)  <!--- MC-20322-->

### Infrastructure improvements

This release contains 250 enhancements to core quality, which improve the quality of the Framework and these modules:  catalog, sales, PayPal, Elasticsearch, import, CMS, and B2B.

### Merchant tool enhancements

*  **Integration with Adobe Stock image galleries**. The new bundled Adobe stock integration extension enables merchants to add high quality media assets to their website content without leaving the Magento Admin. Merchants can use the searchable interface in the Magento Media Gallery to explore, preview, license, and deploy stock images in website content.

### Page Builder

Page Builder enhancements for this release include:

*  Improved product sorting. Merchants can now sort by product position in category or list of product SKUs, and sort by defined parameters such as name or stock status.

*  Improved product carousel. Merchants can choose how to showcase products in their content by selecting from predefined options in Page Builder Products content type.

*  The content that merchants create in Page Builder is optimized for rendering on the storefront using the Venia Theme (PWA Studio). Unstructured content (HTML) that Page Builder generates and saves into a data base is converted into structured data that works in React and PWA Studio.

### Inventory Management

Inventory Management enhancements for this release include:

*  Addressed a known performance issue that caused higher than expected loads on the database server in scenarios involving the shopping cart.
*  Updated the Inventory Reservations CLI command to reduce memory usage when finding and compensating for missing reservations on large catalogs.
*  Resolved multiple quality issues, including those related to credit memos, grouped products, source and stock mass actions.

See [Inventory Management release notes](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/inventory/release-notes.html) for a more detailed discussion of recent GraphQL bug fixes.

### GraphQL

This release includes improved GraphQL coverage for search, layered navigation, cart functionality. The following mutations/queries are available:

*  Ability to link a cart to a customer and retrieve it on different devices.
*  Improved method of returning pricing data to make it easier for GraphQL consumers to render pricing on the storefront.
*  Fixed product tax and product level discount information.
*  Promotion data in cart.
*  Includes line item and cart level discounts.
*  Category filtering - get category data by ID, name, or SLUG.
*  Filter by custom attributes in layered navigation.

See [Release notes](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/release-notes.html) for a more detailed discussion of recent GraphQL bug fixes.

### PWA Studio

For information on these enhancements plus other improvements, see [PWA Studio releases](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/releases)

### dotdigital

Live Chat powered by dotdigital enables merchants to increase conversion rates, and keep customers coming back with real-time engagement. All Magento 2.3.x merchants (both Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce) can receive a free live chat agent, even without being a dotdigital Engagement Cloud customer.

### Google Shopping ads Channel

[Google Shopping ads Channel Release Notes](https://devdocs.magento.com/extensions/google-shopping-ads/release-notes/)  describes all changes to this feature for Magento 2.3.x.

### B2B

New B2B features and improvements include the following:

*  **Ability to export requisition lists into CSV format**. B2B buyers can then perform batch modification for subsequent import into the shopping cart or import back into the requisition list. <!--- MC-17417-->

*  **Granular ACLs for B2B modules**. Merchants can now restrict access to B2B features from the Admin,  controlling which  employees can work with B2B items and settings. <!--- MC-19649-->

### Vendor-developed extension enhancements

This release of Magento includes extensions developed by third-party vendors. It includes both quality and UX improvements to these extensions.

## Backward-incompatible Changes

## Fixed issues

We have fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.3.4 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- MC-19749-->

*  Upgrades no longer fail when deployments contain store information predefined in `app/etc/config.php`. Previously, MySQL locks occurred during the store import phase of upgrade, and Magento threw an error.

<!--- ENGCOM-5619-->

*  The `setup:db-declaration:generate-patch` command now generates a patch file using the `revert()` method as expected when the  `--revertable` option is set to **true**. *Fix submitted by Alexander Taranovsky in pull request [23848](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/23848)*. [GitHub-23847](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23847)

<!--- ENGCOM-6059-->

*  You can now run `bin/magento maintenance:enable` or `bin/magento maintenance:disable` on a deployment with an empty database. Previously, Magento threw an error when you switched maintenance modes with an empty database. *Fix submitted by Ivan Koliadynskyy in pull request [24959](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24959)*. [GitHub-23577](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23577)

<!--- ENGCOM-6040-->

*  In rare circumstances, executing `composer update` disabled all Magento caches, this is now resolved. *Fix submitted by adrian-martinez-interactiv4 in pull request [24892](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24892)*. [GitHub-17634](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17634)

<!--- ENGCOM-5724-->

*  Vendor names can now contain numbers. Previously, Magento threw an error. *Fix submitted by Jason Sylvester in pull request [24324](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24324)*. [GitHub-8037](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8037)

<!--- MC-19642-->

*  Single pipes in `composer.json` files have been changed to double pipes.

### AdminGWS

<!--- MC-18702-->

*  Administrators with restricted access can now view **Content** > **Pages**. Previously, when an administrator tried to access this page, Magento displayed this error: The error `You cannot define a correlation namestore_tablemore than once`.

### Analytics

<!--- ENGCOM-5978-->

*  `module-analytics/Model/ExportDataHandler.php` now generates data in the `Docroot/var/` folder as expected. *Fix submitted by Adarsh Manickam in pull request [24773](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24773)*. [GitHub-24708](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24708)

<!--- MC-19638-->

*  Clicking on the ESC key no longer closes the Admin Analytics popup dialog that Magento displays when an administrator first logs in.

<!--- MC-19639-->

*  Administrators can now use the TAB key only to navigate  between the **Allow** and **Don't Allow** buttons. Previously, an administrator could use the TAB key to navigate out of the dialog.

### Backend

<!--- MC-20622-->

*  Magento now sets the correct Admin locale scope when generating email templates. Previously, email sent from the Admin included incorrect static file paths.

### Bundle products

<!--- MC-19438-->

*  The price and subtotal shown in the cart and mini cart for bundle products is now based on quantity of items and tier price as expected. Previously, if you added a second product to the cart, Magento doubled the product price that was displayed in the cart.

<!--- MC-18963-->

*  The shopping cart now displays correct prices for bundle products when you use the **Add to Cart Button** to add them to cart twice.

<!--- ENGCOM-5534-->

*  Bundle products now show the correct price when bundle options include only one multiple select option. *Fix submitted by Rani Priya in pull request [23902](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/23902)*. [GitHub-23886](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23886)

### B2B

<!--- MC-17862-->

*  You can now access or refresh the Simple Product page for a product created by API. Previously, if you tried to access a product’s page after running `bin/magento cache:flush`, Magento threw an error.

<!--- MC-17007-->

*  You can now successfully set a valid customer to active status using the **Active** action that is available from the All Customers list Actions menu. Previously, when you tried to set a valid customer to active, Magento did not change the customer status and let the status field empty, which prevented you from including this customer when creating a company.

<!--- MC-19185-->

*  Magento no longer displays an option to review Terms and Conditions  whenever you try to place an order from a quote. Previously,  when you tried to check out from a quote when trying to place an order,  you had to check the terms box before clicking **Place order**, and Magento displayed an error.

<!--- MC-19396-->

*  Customer attributes are now displayed as expected on the Add New Company page. Previously, Magento did not display customer attributes on a company's Admin tab even when you enabled the **Values Required** and **Show on Storefront** settings, which prevented you from creating a new company.

<!--- MC-17193-->

*  Users with company administrative privileges can no longer submit reorders for accounts other than their own.

<!--- MC-17803-->

*  The Request a Quote page (accessed by clicking **Request a Quote** from the shopping cart page) now works as expected in deployments running Internet Explorer 11.x.

<!--- MC-19650-->

*  PayPal Express now works as expected as a payment method for quotes. Previously, Magento displayed this error when you tries to complete payment using PayPal Express:  `We can't initialize Express Checkout`.

<!--- MC-20117-->

*  Magento now minimizes requisition lists as expected when multiple wishlists are enabled. Previously, the wishlist remained expanded even when you attempted to close it.

<!--- MC-19944-->

*  Shared catalogs are now listed and identified as expected in the **Product in Shared Catalogs** tab. Previously, when you saved shared categories for a product, Magento either did not display the categories  or did not display them as selected.

<!--- MAGETWO-67450-->

*  Currency rates are no longer duplicated on the Admin Order page.

<!--- MC-19837-->

*  Magento now handles decimal values in product quantities as expected when adding a product to a requisition list. Previously, when you entered a decimal value as a product quantity, Magento added the item quantity to the the requisition list but omitted the decimal value.

<!--- MC-19836-->

*  The Select All checkbox on the Requisition List page now work as expected. Previously, when you deselected all products in a requisition list, the **Select All** checkbox remained enabled.

<!--- MC-20212-->

*  The `cron` job that deletes inactive quotes now affects only standard carts, not negotiable quotes. Previously, a cron job deleted negotiable quotes, which resulted in data loss.

<!--- MC-21876-->

*  Administrators can now successfully place an order again from the Admin. Previously, if the administrator tried to place the order again from the Admin, the **Same as Billing Address** checkbox always defaulted to **true** when the reorder form was rendered. As a result, the billing address overrode the shipping address, and the original shipping address information was lost.

<!--- MC-19649-->

*  Merchants can now restrict access to B2B features from the Admin,  controlling which  employees can work with B2B items and settings.

<!--- MC-20208-->

*  Administrators with appropriate permissions can now create a new user when customer prefixes are enabled. Previously, Magento threw an error.

<!--- MC-21459-->

*  Magento now uses the language set for the store view in which the order was placed when displaying an order's payment information in the Admin. Previously, Magento always derived this information from  the default store view for all orders created in a multi-site deployment.

<!--- MC-21462-->

*  Magento now loads email templates as expected from the Admin **Marketing** > **Email Templates** > **Add New Template** page. Previously, when you tried to add a new template,  Magento displayed this error: `The template did not load. Please review the log for details`.

<!--- MC-21688-->

*  Magento now displays all available products as expected from the Admin Create Order page. Previously, Magento did not display all products whether added by SKU or by using **Add Products**.

<!--- MC-17824-->

*  The **Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price** field on the Advanced Pricing page has been re-labeled to **Minimum Advertised Price**.

<!--- MC-19915-->

*  You can now successfully create a company from the storefront account of another company. Previously, Magento displayed an informative error message.

<!--- MC-17417-->

*  You can now export requisition lists into CSV format. B2B buyers can then perform batch modification for subsequent import into the shopping cart or import back into the requisition list.

### Cache

<!--- MC-19712-->

*  Full page caching now works as expected for non-default store views.

### Cart and checkout

<!--- MC-21926-->

*  Magento now applies the conditions that are imposed by multiple cart price rules correctly. Previously, Magento ignored conditions to remove free shipping when other discounts were valid.

<!--- MC-17869-->

*  Magento now correctly applies cart price rules that apply a 100% discount.

<!--- MC-19053-->

*  Guest users can now checkout after persistent shopping cart has been disabled. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `No cart with such entityId=0`.

<!--- MC-19152-->

*  Magento no longer displays custom dropdown customer address attribute option IDs  on the Review & Payment section of the checkout workflow when a guest checks out. Previously, Magento displayed the option ID instead of the option label for the selected attribute option.

<!--- MC-19637-->

*  Billing and Shipping information no longer disappear from the Payment section of the checkout workflow when an AJAX POST request fails.

<!--- MC-19271-->

*  Magento now displays an error when you upload an incorrect product SKU while creating an order in a non-default store in a multi-store deployment. Previously, Magento displayed an error when this scenario occurred in the default store.

<!--- MC-19894-->

*  Magento no longer displays customer address attribute option IDs  on the dropdown menu of the Shipping section of the checkout workflow. Previously, Magento displayed the option ID instead of the option label for the selected attribute option.

<!--- MC-15507-->

*  Magento no longer drops or updates the shipping address  after a customer update or adds a new billing address zip/postal code when the **My billing and shipping address are the same** setting is disabled.

<!--- MC-17469-->

*  Magento no longer throws a fatal error when you open the shopping cart in a separate window during multishipping checkout.

<!--- MC-17493-->

*  Cart Price Rules tables in multi-site deployments now show existing cart price rules as expected. Previously, the Cart Price Rules page displayed the **Search** button, number of records found, and navigation buttons, but did not display the grid of rules.

<!--- ENGCOM-5525-->

*  You can now use REST to add a  product with customizable options (for example, type checkbox) to the cart. Previously, Magento threw an informative error when you used the POST `/V1/guest-carts/{cartId}/items` endpoint. *Fix submitted by Denis Kopylov in pull request [23871](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/23871)*. [GitHub-23863](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23863)

[GitHub-23895](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23895)

<!--- ENGCOM-5511-->

*  Magento now displays correct product quantities on the Items Ordered  tab of the order page when the price includes a decimal value.  *Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [23943](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/23943)*. [GitHub-23940](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23940)

<!--- ENGCOM-5454-->

*  Magento now saves schedule update settings that are set in **Admin** > **Catalog** > **Categories** > **Category** > **Schedule Design Update** as expected when you change store view. *Fix submitted by kcnariya in pull request [23983](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/23983)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-5790-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when a customer updates a shopping cart with a product quantity that is not in stock. Previously, under these conditions, Magento displayed an inaccurate error message. *Fix submitted by Gustavo Vicente Dauer in pull request [24380](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24380)*. [GitHub-24366](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24366)

<!--- ENGCOM-5811-->

### Catalog

<!--- MC-19398-->

*  Editing the attribute set of a disabled product no longer enables the product on the storefront.

<!--- MC-19090-->

*  Magento now displays category banner images as expected on the category edit and the storefront category pages.

*  When an administrator sets the out-of-stock threshold for a product to a negative value and allows backorders below a quantity of  0, customers can backorder a product until the out-of-stock-threshold value matches the product's stock quantity. Previously, the out-of-stock threshold had no effect, and the given product stayed in stock and could be backordered without limit.

<!--- MC-19916-->

*  Storeview-specific attributes are now included in layered navigation results even when the **All Store Views** setting is not enabled.

<!--- MAGETWO-45666-->

Only one of those added lines is necessary to run Magento, and many installations are configured such that the two optional lines are not needed. *Fix submitted by Alexander Taranovsky in pull request [24187](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24187)*.
